## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.**

### What to Report

Report issues that could:
- Expose sensitive legal information
- Bypass ethical safeguards or disclaimers
- Cause agents to provide dangerous legal advice
- Leak confidential data or API keys
- Compromise repository integrity

### How to Report

**Preferred Method:**
1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
   - Go to repository Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed description

**Alternative Method:**
- Email maintainers directly (if GitHub reporting unavailable)
- Include:
  - Description of vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

**Timeline:**
- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment:** Within 7 days
- **Status Update:** Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution:** Varies by severity

**Severity Levels:**
- **Critical:** Immediate response, patch within 24-48 hours
- **High:** Response within 48 hours, patch within 7 days
- **Medium:** Response within 7 days, patch within 30 days
- **Low:** Response within 14 days, patch as schedule permits

## Security Considerations for Users

### AI Legal Tool Limitations

**Remember:**
- AI agents provide information, NOT legal advice
- Always verify critical information with licensed counsel
- Do not rely solely on AI for high-stakes legal matters
- Agents may have knowledge cutoff limitations

### Data Privacy

**Best Practices:**
- Do not input confidential client information
- Avoid sharing personally identifiable information (PII)
- Do not include privileged attorney-client communications
- Sanitize all examples and hypotheticals

### API Key Security

**If using Claude API:**
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor usage for anomalies

## Responsible Disclosure

**We appreciate responsible disclosure:**
- Give us reasonable time to fix issues before public disclosure
- Work with us on coordinated disclosure timeline
- Provide credit attribution if desired

**Recognition:**
- Public acknowledgment in release notes (with your permission)
- Listed in security hall of fame (if we create one)

## Out of Scope

**NOT security vulnerabilities:**
- Legal inaccuracies (report via GitHub Issues)
- Agent prompt improvements (contribute via PR)
- Feature requests (use GitHub Issues)
- General questions (see CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Legal Disclaimer

**This security policy applies to the repository and software only.**

Security issues with legal advice or analysis provided by agents should be treated as legal accuracy issues, not security vulnerabilities. Always consult licensed counsel for important legal matters.
